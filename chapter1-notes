and wearing ski masks.  Ben is nervious but his older brother is telling
him he has to do this.  The leader of the gang signals that is time to 
go and they head into the bank.  During the robbery Ben accidently 
shoots and kills the guard.  He tries to help but is dragged away by

out of the bank, sirens can be heard in the distance.  The group heads 
back to the alley next to the bank.  Ben notices a small girl in the

into the road and pushes the girl out of the way just in time.  Ben is 
hit by the truck and killed.  The gang has been watching the scene 
from the alley, Ben's brother is visibily upset that his younger 
brother has just been killed, the gang leader mutters something about 
Ben and that they have to get out of there.
